This directory will be used primarily for images and whatnot.

Some raw images were found on google images, while more specific (tileset) images are from:
http://www.spriters-resource.com/

file explanations:
    - tmx: xml styled formatting of various maps, generated from Tiled
    - png: standard image used with SDL2Image
    - xcf: GIMP image for tayloring
    - *rule*: file for Tiled automapping...

NOTE: the tile set grabbed from spriters-resource seems to be off... may need to find a new resource for these images
