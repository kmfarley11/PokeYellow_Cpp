# UNIT-TESTS: PokeYellow_Cpp
The source code will be briefly described below (information is currently tentative).

This is where we will build unit tests to appropriately validate our objects.

NOTE: the .a files are needed to properly reference our resources. If you lose them then you must build google test/ mock and link them appropriately.

Tools we will use are googletest and googlemock.

See the license directory for more info and a copy of the open source license.

*THE FOLLOWING ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE*
Test Design (by the object)
--------------
 - tester (cpp): code to execute tests / suites
