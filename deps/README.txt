if using windows, you will need to extract the contents of the following:
 - [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php#source) (package libsdl2-dev for linux)
 - [SDL2_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) (package libsdl2-image-dev for linux)
the extracted files will need to go in here and be renamed to SDL2 and SDL2_image
